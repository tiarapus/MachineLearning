# Project Description
EGP is an online platform that empowers local communities, particularly in the Bali area, by promoting ecotourism businesses. 
Our platform offers a range of ecotourism packages, showcases environmentally-friendly destinations, implements eco-quest features to reduce our carbon footprint, 
and provides regular social media updates on environmental activities. By leveraging machine learning, our goal is to offer users a sustainable and eco-friendly 
travel experience, aligning with our motto, "Journey to a Sustainable Future."

## Machine Learning Core Responsibilities
As machine learning engineers within our team, my partner and I were tasked with developing a personalized recommendation system. 
Our responsibilities included implementing both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches using scikit-learn.
We then integrated these models into a machine learning API using Python Flask. This allowed the mobile app to seamlessly deliver data and 
retrieve prediction results to display within the application.
